    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able understand how to use loops in your work to save you time and earth credits.</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to count to over a million using just your fingers and toes.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama">Yayoi Kusama</a></div>
  <div>The first piece of work I saw of hers was <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/kusama-the-passing-winter-t12821">The Passing Winter"</a>, which is owned by the Tate. Go see it!
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Earlier in my career I was lucky enough to collaborate on an installation inspired by that piece: <a href="http://thehellocube.com/">The Hello Cube</a>.</p>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/42708883?color=ffffff&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Yayoi's work is about repetition, which is why she's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly that thing!</div>
  <div>Intro paragraph here about the magic of loops - like micky mouse in fantasia</div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. Looping - doing things many times, but using logic to stop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Loops such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop">while loops</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loops</a> are also very common.</li>
      <li>Let's try writing some loops in p5.js on the editor to print things out.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/learn/program-flow.html - let's return to this from the last lecture, but with our new knowledge</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/control-iteration.html - iteration is just another word for repeating, or doing the same thing several times, in slightly different ways.</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/control-conditionals-1.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/control-conditionals-2.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/control-logical-operators.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/structure-functions.html - combining loops with functions</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/drawing-patterns.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/math-distance-2d.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-kaleidoscope.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/data-variable-scope.html - SCOPE!</div>
  <div>Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
