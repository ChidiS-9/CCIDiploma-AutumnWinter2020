  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to count to over a million using just your fingers and toes.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/agnes-martin/who-is-agnes-martin">Agnes
      Martin</a></div>
  <div>I was first drawn to her work by a quote:"To progress in life you must give up the things that you do not like. Give up doing the things that you do not like to do. You must find the things that you do like. The things that are acceptable to your mind."
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Agnes's work is about counting and remembering, which is why she's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!
  </div>
  <div>A few more artists for you.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/anni-albers">Anni
      Albers</a> said: "Being creative is not so much the desire to do something as the listening to that which wants to be done: the dictation of the materials." Don't forget to listen to your materials.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/nam-june-paik-tv-buddha/">Nam June Paik</a> said: "Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence." - let's talk about this in the next session after this lecture.

      Nauman</a> said "what makes the work interesting is if you choose the right questions." - what questions do you want to ask? BTW: <a href="www.newmedia-art.org">newmedia-art.org is a great resource</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Some thoughts about practice.</div>
  <div>
    What is Practice? When I thought about it, it helped me alot. I like it because the word has many meanings, like many words. What meanings does it have for you? Have you heard it at UAL alot? What is a practice? What is your practice? What is the question that moves you in a direction? Or in no direction? <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/AHOPresentationTheFuture2019/#/">My presentation about the future</a> that I also presented in Oslo recently.

  </div>
  <div>Now, finally, to counting. What is counting?</div>
  <div>
    Counting is using groups of symbols to represent quantities or amounts. Let's count to 100 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">Decimal</a>. When do
    we need an extra digit?
  </div>
  <div>Let's count to 10 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">Unary</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Let's count to 20 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Binary</a>. When
    do we need an extra digit?
  </div>
  <div>
    What's the biggest number you can count to on your fingers? On your fingers and toes?
  </div>
  <div>Tell the binary joke Joel!</div>
  <div>
    Computers use binary to represent everything in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a>. Why? Why is binary well suited to digital computers?
    <ul>
      <li>A bit is a Binary digIT.</li>
      <li>A byte is eight bits. (BEight).</li>
      <li>A kilobyte is 1,024 (2^10) bytes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">mostly</a>.
      </li>
      <li>A megabyte is 1,048,576 (2^20) bytes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte">mostly</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>One megabyte is approximately one minute of 128 kbit/s MP3 compressed music.</li>
      <li>One megabyte is six seconds of uncompressed CD audio.</li>
      <li>One megabyte is a typical English book volume in plain text format (500 pages Ã— 2000
        characters per page).</li>
      <li>The human genome consists of DNA representing 800 MB of data. The parts that differentiate one person from another can be compressed to 4 MB!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>There are different ways of storing numbers and words in computers, as a whole these values
        are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">Data types</a>.</li>
      <li>Whole numbers or Integers are stored as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29">ints</a>. E.g. 0, 5,
        -567.</li>
      <li>Numbers which are in between whole numbers are stored as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">Floating Points or
          floats</a>. E.g. 3.142 or -5.66343.</li>
      <li>As these numbers are stored in certain amounts of memory, if they get too big (or negative,
        or precise) the computer can run out of memory to store them, or overflow. This is bad. See
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K bug</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>You can also store individual characters of the alphabet as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)">chars</a>.</li>
      <li>However, there are different encodings of characters - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> for example - which allow
        different character sets to be displayed.</li>
      <li>You can store words (multiple characters) in strings - which are actually just lists of
        chars.</li>
      <li>Another name for lists are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">arrays</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Strings are one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension">dimensional</a> arrays.
        We'll be discussing more about arrays or lists in lecture 5.</li>
      <li>Data can be stored as fixed values (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(computer_programming)">constants</a>) or
        values that can change (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29">variables</a>).

      <li>Thanks to <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10298">Terrence J. Sejnowski and his
          article on Edge.org</a> for the following examples.</li>
      <li>How many seconds are there in a lifetime? 10^9 seconds.</li>
      <li><q>A second is an arbitrary time unit, but one that is based on our experience. Our visual
          system is bombarded by snapshots at a rate of around 3 per second caused by rapid eye
          movements called saccades. Athletes often win or lose a race by a fraction of a second.
          If you earned a dollar for every second in your life you would be a billionaire.
          However, a second can feel like a minute in front of an audience and a quiet weekend can
          disappear in a flash. As a child, a summer seemed to last forever, but as an adult,
          summer is over almost before it begins. William James speculated that subjective time
          was measured in novel experiences, which become rarer as you get older. Perhaps life is
          lived on a logarithmic time scale, compressed toward the end.</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the GDP of the world? $10^14.</li>
      <li><q>A billion dollars was once worth a lot, but there is now a long list of
          multibillionaires. The US government recently stimulated the world economy by loaning
          several trillion dollars to banks. It is difficult to grasp how much a trillion dollars
          ($10^12) represents, but several clever videos on YouTube (key words: trillion dollars)
          illustrate this with physical comparisons (a giant pile of $100 bills) and what you can
          buy with it (10 years of US response to 9/11). When you start thinking about the world
          economy, the trillions of dollars add up. A trillion here, a trillion there, pretty soon
          your talking about real money. But so far there aren't any trillionaires.</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>How many synapses are there in the brain? 10^15.</li>
      <li><q>Two neurons can communicate with each other at a synapse, which is the computational unit
          in the brain. The typical cortical synapse is less than a micron in diameter (10^-6
          metres), near the resolution limit of the light microscope. If the economy of the world
          is a stretch for us to contemplate, thinking about all the synapses in your head is mind
          boggling. If I had a dollar for every synapse in your brain I could support the current
          economy of the world for 10 years. Cortical neurons on average fire once a second, which
          implies a bandwidth of around 10^15 bits per second, greater than the total bandwidth of
          the internet backbone.</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>How many seconds will the sun shine? 10^17 seconds</li>
      <li><q>Our sun has shined for billions of years and will continue to shine for billions more.
          The universe seems to be standing still during our lifetime, but on longer time scales
          the universe is filled with events of enormous violence. The spatial scales are also
          immense. Our space-time trajectory is a very tiny part of the universe, but we can at
          least attach powers of 10 to it and put it into perspective.</q></li>
