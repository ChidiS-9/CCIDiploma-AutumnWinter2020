  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to logic to allow your software to make decisions about the world.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt">Sol LeWitt</a> was a pioneer in minimalist and conceptual art, drawing up rules or algorithms that then could be carried out by anyone - "The system is the work of art; the visual work of art is the proof of the system". <a href="http://solvingsol.com/">Solving Sol</a>, Javascript implementations of his works.</div>
  <div><a href="http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/">History of Design Systems</a> by <a href="https://runemadsen.com/">Rune Madsen</a> has a series of references on Sol LeWitt and others.</div>>
  <div>Great <a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art">recent article on Generative Art</a> by Jason Bailey.</div>
  <div>I think alot of Sol's work is about rules, which is why he's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>
    <h3>2. Deciding - logic in humans and computers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean algebra</a>, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type">Boolean data type</a> is a common to most programming languages - only two values - True (1) or False (0). One is true, nothing is false.</li>
      <li>Boolean operators allow you to combine or invert boolean data types - the three basic ones are AND, OR and NOT.</li>
      <li>Control flow in programming is how you control the flow of which part of the program is executed next.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)">Conditional statements</a>, such as if statements are very common.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/structure-setup-and-draw.html lets try this example, which demonstrates the use of an if statement</div>
  <div>
    <h3>2. Functions and recursion.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of writing long lists of commands, one after another, functions allow programmers to package up functionality into smaller mini programs, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">functions or subroutines</a>.</li>
      <li>Take input and return an output - an example might be a function that returns the square of an input number, or as complicated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">the answer to everything</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">Recursion</a> is when something is defined in terms of itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Recursive_humor">Recursive humour is funny</a>. Recursion is also found in graphic design, art and cooking. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">computer science recursion</a> is when a function calls itself repeatedly. The method of working out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursive_procedures">Factorial of any number</a> is a classic example.</li>
      <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a> is a good example of something that is visually recursive.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. The Jacquard Loom, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">The Jacquard Loom</a> was the worlds first programmable object.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> is the inventor of the concept of a digital computer. Babbage was aware of the Jacquard Loom and expanded upon the punch card to invent both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> was the worlds first computer programmer, even realising that the computer could be used to make music and art.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Pāṇini, al-Khwarizmi, al-Jazari, Alan Turing, Tommy Flowers, Grace Hopper, Margaret Hamilton, Bugs and Hacking.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a> pioneered a grammar that incorporated metarules and recursion - making the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a> formalised algebra, his name gave rise to the word algorithm and introduced the decimal system to the western world.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_al-Jazari">Ismail al-Jazari</a> invented programmable machines, including programmable humanoid robots and an astronomical clock considered the first programmable analogue computer.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Pāṇini, al-Khwarizmi, al-Jazari, Alan Turing, Tommy Flowers, Grace Hopper, Margaret Hamilton, Bugs and Hacking (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> formalised the concept of the algorithm and computation in general. During the Second World War he led the team that broke German Naval codes. He went on to design one of the first stored program computers and did pioneering work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis">Morphogenesis</a>, or how living things form themselves. He was prosecuted by the British Government for being gay, and committed suicide in 1954. If an system is capable of general computation it is said to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> is a test of machine intelligence in comparison to human intelligence.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Flowers">Tommy Flowers</a> was the engineer who built Turing's machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Moving from two spatial dimensions to three</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Going from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square">square</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube">cube</a>.</li>
      <li>The third dimension is usually described in terms of a new letter: z.</li>
      <li>The direction and orientation of the three dimensions varies in a similar way to the way the direction of y varies in two dimensions between high school graphs and digital screen co-ordinates, so always check which way is what.</li>
      <li>See how <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/measure-any-distance-with-the-pythagorean-theorem/">Pythagoras works in three dimensions in this Better Explained article</a>.</li>
      <li>Also see this <a href="http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html">Immersive linear algebra course</a> - what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">Linear Algebra?</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Moving from two spatial dimensions to three (continued)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One way of storing three dimensional information is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud">point clouds</a>.</li>
      <li>The output of three dimensional scanners is often in point clouds - a grid of positions, each with a depth value - think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_Art">Pin Art</a> toys from the 1980's.</li>
      <li>Another way of storing three dimensional data is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">Voxels</a> (from the initial letters of volume and element, with the insertion of -x- for ease of pronunciation).</li>
      <li>Voxels can be a super efficient way of storing three dimension information - used for everything from MRI scanners to Minecraft.</li>
      <li>Creative uses of points in space: <a href="https://universaleverything.com/projects/motorstudio-design-room">Motorstudio Design Room </a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyNHJQzn3pw">Hermès × Tokujin Yoshioka</a> / <a href="https://www.clairesophie.com/shining360excerpt">Shining360 by Claire Hentschker</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Moving from two spatial dimensions to three (continued)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Another way of storing three dimensional information is using a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">polygons</a>.</li>
      <li>Polygons are geometric objects with at least three straight lines and angles.</li>
      <li>Polygons are plane figures - i.e. they are flat.</li>
      <li>Some examples: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square">squares</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle">triangles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon">pentagons</a>.</li>
      <li>Triangles are often used in three dimensional software and games - for more information about why this is so see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyvizaygyY">Computerphile video about A Universe of Triangles</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Moving from two spatial dimensions to three (continued)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron">Polyhedron</a> is a three dimensional shape made of multiple polygons.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">The Platonic Solids</a> are a set of three dimensional shapes that have been known about since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Ancient Greece</a> and possibly back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times.</li>
      <li><a href="http://paulbourke.net/">Paul Bourke maintains an amazing list of algorithms and code for dealing with: Geometry, Surfaces, Curves, Polyhedra, Fractals, Chaos, Self similarity, Photographic reconstruction, Domes, Planetariums, Fisheye, Spherical mirror, Stereographics and 3D Projection</a>. It's always my first place to check if I've got a geometric question.</li>
    </ul>
