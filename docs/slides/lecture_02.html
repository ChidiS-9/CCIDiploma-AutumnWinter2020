    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be understand how everything your computer displays on it's screen is an illusion and not really in motion at all.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="http://lillian.com/">Lilian
      Schwarz</a></div>
  <div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/98960229?portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/98960229">Lillian Schwartz</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/147750678">Ben
        Rubin</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Lilian's work is about drawing and colouring, which is why she's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. Drawing on paper.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Next we are going to talk about drawing, first on a piece of paper. Later, We are also going to think about the idea of dimensions - how many variables we use to describe something - the most common you've encountered so far probably being space - or the spatial dimensions.</li>
      <li>Before we get onto that, lets get into three's and get a piece of paper for each group and a pen each too.</li>
      <li>One person is going to be the model, one person is going to be the blind drawing robot and one person is going to be the sighted drawing instruction robot.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. Drawing on paper (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Model - you have to make sure the blind drawing robot doesn't cheat, and pose your hand using a secret number of fingers.</li>
      <li>Blind drawing robot - listen for commands.</li>
      <li>Sighted drawing instruction robot - which command are you going to give first? You aren't allowed to say how many fingers the hand model is holding up, you can only say commands like "take off pen lid" or "move your hand down until I say stop".</li>
      <li>Go!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/get-started/ lets do this tutorial - some things we'll learn about later but most imporant thing is to swap from 50,50 to mouseX and mouseY</div>
  <div>Let's go through this tutorial together: https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html</div>
  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/structure-coordinates.html</div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Moving from zero spatial dimensions to one and on to two.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Starting with zero spatial (or physical space) dimensions - a point.</li>
      <li>Moving from zero spatial dimensions to one and on to two or going from a point to line to a square.</li>
      <li>Artwork: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>4. Moving from zero spatial dimensions to one and on to two (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How do we describe points on a square or a flat piece of paper so that other people know where we are describing?</li>
      <li>Formally: (x,y) pairs are used to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian co-ordinates</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space">Euclidean space</a>.</li>
      <li>X is for measuring how much left or right on the piece of paper, and Y is for measuring how much up or down on the piece of paper.</li>
      <li>Y on computers is the opposite way to the way you learnt in school - because old computers scanned from the top down using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">Cathode Ray Tubes</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area">Area</a> - if you double the width and the height, area scales x4 NOT x2.</li>
      <li>Pythagoras' theorem is used to work out how big the longest side of a triangle with a right angle in it is - see proofs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Wikipedia page</a> and <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/surprising-uses-of-the-pythagorean-theorem/">Better Explained</a>. P.S. <a href="https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/">Better Explained is AWESOME</a>!</li>

    <h3>4. Moving from zero spatial dimensions to one and on to two (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>? "It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point".</li>
      <li><a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-gentle-introduction-to-learning-calculus/">A Gentle Introduction To Learning Calculus</a> from Better Explained. Calculus is the formal name for thinking about graphs - the area under a curve (or the integral) or how steep a curve is (the differential).</li>
      <li>Sine waves are curves that go up and down in a regular way forever.<a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-sine-waves/">Intuitive Understanding of Sine Waves</a>.</li>
      <li>How to work out the size of angles in a triangle using the lengths of a triangle or other angles aka Sine and cosine and tangent functions aka <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-trigonometry/">Trigonometry</a> again, from Better Explained.</li>

  <div>https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-follow-2.html - too arrayey?</div>

    <h3>4. Moving from zero spatial dimensions to one and on to two (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> is the diagram of boundaries between a set of points such that within the boundaries, one is closer to that point than any other.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay triangulation</a> is the diagram of triangles of the Voronoi diagram such that no triangle is within another.</li>
      <li>The Voronoi diagram <a href="http://www.raymondhill.net/voronoi/rhill-voronoi.html">interactively</a>.</li>
      <li>Artwork: <a href="https://www.snibbe.com/digital-art#/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions/">Boundary Functions</a> by <a href="https://www.snibbe.com/">Scott Snibbe</a>, who now works for Facebook.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>6. Colour and colour on computers.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can map any three variables into three dimensions to help you think about them spatially (i.e. in physical space).</li>
      <li>An example of this is mixing together Red, Green and Blue (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>) colours to make any other colour.</li>
      <li>Digital colour mixing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">additive</a> while analogue paint mixing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color">subtractive</a>.</li>
      <li>How does projected light mix?</li>
      <li>There are other ways of mixing variables to make colours - for example Hue, Saturation and Brightness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSB</a>).</li>
      <li>I often use HSB in digital work to make it easy to blend between colours - much easier than RGB. You can visualise colour using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel">colour wheel</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_solid">colour solid</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors">Complementary colours</a> are on opposite sides of the colour wheel.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory">Colour theory</a> is a huge area of study, for graphic design and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology">psychology</a>.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <h3>6. Colour and colour on computers (continued).</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rune Madsen's great series "Programming Design systems" has brilliant chapters on <a href="https://www.programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/index.html">A short history of color(sic) theory</a>, <a href=" https://www.programmingdesignsystems.com/color/color-models-and-color-spaces/index.html">Color(sic) models and color(sic) spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/index.html">Perceptually uniform color(sic) spaces</a>. Let's take a look. (sic) means I know it's spelt wrong!</li>
