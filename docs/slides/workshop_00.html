  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our first workshop!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, you'll have done the following things:
    <ul>
      <li>Have gotten to know the structure of the Diploma and this unit by checking out the Unit 1 GitHub</li>
      <li>Signed up for Github.com so you can edit the Unit 1 Wiki and make your own projects</li>
      <li>Signed up for the p5.js forum so you can post to it and be helped and help others</li>
      <li>Signed up for the p5.js editor so you can make new code on the web and share it with others</li>
      <li>Got your Wu-Tang name so you can start your career in Hip-Hop</li>
      <li>Introduced yourself to each other via the Unit 1 Wiki by answering some questions and followed me (@jgl) on Instagram</li>
      <li>Understood why I gave you a Rubber Duck as a present</li>
      <li>Understood why I want you to work in threes in workshops and throughout the Diploma</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    I want you to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020">Unit 1 GitHub if you haven't already</a>. Is there anything that isn't clear? Message me on Slack if you have any questions.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/join">Sign up for GitHub.com</a>. Once you've chosen a username, message me on the CCI Slack with your username so I can add you as a collaborator to the Unit 1 Github. This will enable you to edit the wiki page later with answers to my questions.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">Sign up for the p5.js forum</a>. This will enable you to post questions and projects, get help and help others.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/signup">Sign up for the p5.js editor</a>. This will enable you to write p5.js code on the web and share it with others really easily. This is the way that I recommend you start working in p5.js and also the way that you'll sit the two hour programming exam at the end of the unit.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php">Get your Wu-Tang name, just like Donald Glover did</a>. Then you can start your career in Hip-Hop. Have a discussion of how you think it works. What happens if you put slightly different names in? Same first name and different last names? What is going on under the hood? How is this black box working? Remember <a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/miscellaneous_references/">Jim Campbell's diagram</a>? What is the input and output in this case?
  </div>
  <div>
    Now that you've got your GitHub username and messaged it to me on the CCI Slack, you should be able to <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/wiki/People">edit the people page on our wiki directly</a>. Just copy and paste my answers and add your own. Here are the questions I want you to answer:
    <ul>
      <li>How you want people to address you?</li>
      <li>How you are feeling today?</li>
      <li>What course are you doing at UAL?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite song and muscian at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite writer and book at the moment?</li>
      <li>Who is your favourte artist at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite thing to do at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your Instagram? I'm <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jgl/">@jgl</a> - I follow back! I'm also on TikTok. Are you? Which other platforms should I be on?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Why did I give you a Rubber Duck? Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a> of course! But why is that important? What does Dorey do? What makes it easier to do what Dorey does?
  </div>
  <div>
    Why do I want you to work in threes? Can you think of three reasons? Discuss in your groups.
