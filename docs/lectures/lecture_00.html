    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm Joel Gethin Lewis.</div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Creative Computing Institute!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Diploma in Creative Computing!
  </div>
  <div>
    You are all Diplomats now. (-;
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about: <ul>
      <li>the cci</li>
      <li>the diploma in creative coding</li>
      <li>what creative coding is</li>
      <li>the programming language I'm going to be teaching you up to Christmas (Javascript)</li>
      <li>and the specific programming library we are going to be using (p5.js)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>What is the CCI?</div>
  <div>What is the Diploma in Creative Coding? Why am I teaching it?</div>
  <div>You've all read about the course, but what am I going to be teaching?</div>
  <div>
    Brain exploding and creative coding. BTW, I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish I'd had it when I was young. Also it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books that I couldn't afford when I was at university.
  </div>
  <div>I'd really encourage you to take the time to look at the references I put up through these lectures. Think of them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a> to get you to the next level quicker than I did.</div>
  <div>
    I'm going to <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic word to search for if you want to know more. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a> is a BIG problem.
  </div>
  <div>What is creative coding? I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want to teach you how to code but also how you could use coding to change the way you practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Through teaching you creative coding, I want to teach you Computational Thinking. But what is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up!</div>
  <div>Who am I?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Born in London, grew up in Wales on a mountain.</li>
      <li>BSc in Maths and Computer Science at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial</a>, MA in Interaction Design at <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Art</a>.</li>
      <li>One year at <a href="http://www.fabrica.it/">Fabrica</a>.</li>
      <li>Three years at <a href="http://uva.co.uk/">UnitedVisualArtists</a>.</li>
      <li>Eight years at <a href="https://vimeo.com/hellicarandlewis">Hellicar&Lewis</a>.</li>
      <li>Three years of visting lecturing at <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/architecture-spatial-and-interior-design/postgraduate/ma-narrative-environments-csm">CSM MA Narrative Environments</a> and <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/schools/school-of-communication/visual_communication/">RCA Visual Communication</a> and <a href=" https://joelgethinlewis.com/">working on my own projects</a>.</li>
      <li>One year as head lecturer on the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma">Diploma in Creative Computing at the Creative Computing Institute</a>. One year as the <a href="https://universaleverything.com/">Interactive Creative Director of Universal Everything</a>.</li>
      <li>Currently researching Solar-powered mesh based computing and global-scale open source Augmented Reality sculpture</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    So, I'm going to teach you how to code!
  </div>
  <div>
    But much more than that - as mentioned previously, I'm going to teach you different ways of thinking about the universe. I want you to explore thinking in multiple dimensions, how mathematics can help you do that and what dimensions you might want to think in?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of time?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of play?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of care?
  </div>
  <div>
    What lenses can you think of with how to view the world?
  </div>
  <div>
    I'm going to teach you JavaScript, which is one of the most popular languages in the world right now.
  </div>
  <div>
    I'm going to teach you JavaScript using a library called p5.js. p5.js was specifically designed as a great way for designers, artists and others to learn to code.
